# Programming_for_Statics

At the beginning of the course, we will learn how to implement some computational algorithm in
Python language which helps us to be comfortable with Python language in general. You are also
required to be comfortable with linear regression and logistic regression. At then end of class,
we will learn how to implement linear regression and logistic regression using pytorch and
tensorflow so that you are ready to implement the neural network in other future courses.
